    I know, the time range I spend my time in college is almost 8 years.
    Sigh !!! .. But hey, I learnt a lot about computer technology especially
    GNU/Linux during that time. Even I create my own Linux Distro for my
    Internet Cafe's operating system. One of the reasons that I lost focus to
    finish my thesis, but then I choose the same topic as my thesis. :P

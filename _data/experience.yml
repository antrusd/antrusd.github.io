    Along with my team, we were working to handle thousand of bare-metal server
    and virtual machines. One of my achievement there was built automation
    provisioning system with [<mark>Foreman</mark>](https://theforeman.org/)
    that able to parallel provisioning bare-metal server so that provisioning 80
    or even more new bare-metal server requires same amount of time as
    installing single server, something that we used to have to do manually.
